<h1>**MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM**</h1>

This model is based on Content based tags.
We seggregate all the words of each movie such as director,genre,cast,crew etc of each movie and consider them as tags .
Based on the similarity of the tags we recommend movies to the audience.
We used python libraries such as numpy,pandas,ast,nltk,cosine_similarity,pickle.
